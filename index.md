FeatureBase is a [B-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree) database which uses [Roaring Bitmaps](https://roaringbitmap.org/). This makes it suitable for doing analytical queries on massive data sets immediately after ingestion. If you are the inquisitive type, you may be interested in the [architectural overview](https://docs.featurebase.com/community/community-setup/architecture).
